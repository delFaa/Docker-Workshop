# Development

## Introduction
The development environment part should be focused on how to create, configure
and use custom images. All that to end up with an appropriate and working
environment tailored for ones need. Which would demonstrate the potential of 
simplification of the development process. It's also important, during this 
phase, to emphasise the separation of service in different containers and 
therefore introduce **docker-compose** as a tool to bind an application
together.
