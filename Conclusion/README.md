# Conclusion

## Introduction
To finish the workshop I advice for a small discussion/debate between everyone
on what as been learned, how it might be useful and how they plan to use it or
not. That conclusion should, in my opinion, close the workshop in such a way
that everyone has more than his/her own opinion on the technology. It would also
serve the purpose of giving a feedback on the workshop.
