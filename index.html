        <h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to this introduction to the world of Docker, if you want to learn
        a new technology, discover a DevOps tool or understand how you can make your
        life as a developer or system administrator easier, then look no further!</p>
        <p>You might not become expert at the end of the day, but you will have gathered
        enough knowledge to improve skills and set of tools. Furthermore, you will know
        how to use Docker, create your own container, make a custom development environment
        and deploy very easily with Docker.</p>
        <p>Notice that this Github page is nothing more than a guide to help you through
        the learning process. I take the stance that to learn you need to exercise but
        even more importantly research. As such you won't be given every piece of info
        on the technology but the very basics and you will be advised to go to the doc or
        ask questions to have a deeper understanding and finish this workshop with success.</p>
        <!-- First part of the workshop  -->
        <h2 id="Docker">Docker</h2>
        During the next hour or so you will learn the very basics of Docker commands
        and Dockerfile. With the help of which you'll be ready to face your first
        challenge, being able to create a simple container.
        <h3 id="Install">Installation</h3>
        <p>Before anything we will have to install docker and configure it for the
        first time. Sadly and as is often the case in computer science, there is
        no one way to install for all the operating system, but don't dispear it's
        an easy process noneless.</p>
        <h4 id="Linux">Linux</h4>
        <p>On a linux distribution Docker is as simple to install as using your
        package manager.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Ubuntu</b>: <code>sudo apt-get install docker</code></li>
          <li><b>Archlinux</b>: <code>sudo pacman -S docker</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You could also install Docker manually, refer to the website for more info.</p>
        <h4 id="Windows">Windows</h4>
        <p>For windows, you can find the Docker community edition by following this
        link and the instruction to install.</p>
        <a href="https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows">Download</a>
        <h4 id="MacOS">MacOS</h4>
        <p>For Mac, you can find the Docker community edition by following this
        link and the instruction to install.</p>
        <a href="https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac">Download</a>
        <h3 id="Commands">Commands</h3>
        <p>Docker can be controlled with a plethora of commands in the terminal.
        These commands can vary from helping you run, create, analyze and much more.
        Yet if you wanted to learn all of them it would take you more than a day 
        no doubt, which is why, in the table below, you will found a selection
        of the most important ones as well as a small description.</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th><b>Commands</b></th>
            <th><b>Descriptions</b></th> 
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>pull</i></td>
            <td>Pull an image on your local machine</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>run</i></td>
            <td>Pull and run an image on your local machine</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>build</i></td>
            <td>Create an image from a Dockerfile</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>ps</i></td>
            <td>List the containers on you system and their infos</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>images</i></td>
            <td>List the images on your system and their infos</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>rm</i></td>
            <td>Remove a container from your system</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>rmi</i></td>
            <td>Remove an image from your system</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>As said before there are more commands associated with Docker but if
        you understand the ones above you're already set for a good start. However,
        for more info, you can use <kbd>man docker command</kbd> on any unix
        system or follow this link to some 
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/">documentation</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="DockerfileDocker">Dockerfile: part one</h3>
        <p>A Dockerfile is very much like a script, you just have to indicate what
        step you want your image to go throw before it is created.</p>
        <p>Let's say you want a container with Ubuntu and a couple of packages already
        installed, plus you want it to execute a couple of commands automatically
        for you. Let's look at an example:</p>
        <pre><code>
          From ubuntu 

          RUN echo "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main universe" > /etc/apt/sources.list
          RUN apt-get update
          RUN apt-get upgrade -y

          CMD echo "Hello world, I'm up to date."
        </code></pre>
        <p>This example can be decomposed as such, the first command of each line
        is part of the Dockerfile syntax followed by instruction in regard to that
        command. The said instruction in the example above are: the canvas of our
        image (FROM) of which you can have multiple, bash commands to execute
        either during the creation of the container (RUN) or after it's creation (CMD)</p>
        <p>During this first part on Dockerfile we wont go much further as we shall
        see more complex features during the second part, but for more info here
        is a link to some 
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder">documentation</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="ExoDocker">Exercises</h3>
        <p>The best way to learn being to practice hero comes some exercises to put
        yourself to the test.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Pull the image "busybox"</p></li>
          <code>docker pull busybox</code>
          <li><p>List the existing image(s)</p></li>
          <code>docker images</code>
          <li><p>Run the image "hello-world"</p></li>
          <code>docker run hello-world</code>
          <li><p>List all the existing container(s)</p></li>
          <code>docker ps -a</code>
          <li><p>Run a container "busybox" with an interactive terminal</p></li>
          <code>docker run -it busybox</code>
          <li><p>Run a container "busybox" with an interactive terminal and the current
          directory as mounted volume inside the "test" directory of the container</p></li>
          <code>docker run -it -v $PWD:/test busybox</code>
          <li><p>Remove the existing container(s)</p></li>
          <code>docker rm NameOrIdContainer</code>
          <li><p>Remove the existing image(s)</p></li>
          <code>docker rmi NameOrIdImage</code>
          <li><p>Create, build and run a custom image with a Dockerfile based on "busybox"
          and make it output the sentence "I created my first custom image"</p></li>
          <h5>Commands</h5>
          <code>docker build -t myimage .<br>docker run myimage</code>
          <h5>Dockerfile</h5>
          <code>FROM busybox<br>CMD echo "I created my first custom image"</code>
        </ol>
        <p>If you finished all the exercises before the time is up, you should either
        help others or improve your skills with what you learned so far.</p>

        <!-- Second part of the workshop -->
        <h2 id="Development">Development</h2>
        <h3 id="DockerfileDev">Dockerfile: part two</h3>
        <p>Now that you are a little more experienced with Dockerfile we will sink
        deeper into the rabbit hole. You can tweaks a lot of things with the help of
        the Docker syntax, the files you want to use, the port on which your container
        is listening, etc ... So during this part we will explore some of these
        advance features by first looking at an example:</p>
        <pre><code></code></pre>
        <p></p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th><b>Dockerfile element</b></th>
            <th><b>Descriptions</b></th> 
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>FROM</i></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>RUN</i></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>CMD</i></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>WORKDIR</i></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>ADD</i></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>EXPOSE</i></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>As always you can go further so, for more info a link to some documentation on 
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder">Dockerfile</a>.</p>
        <h4 id="ExoDockerfile">Exercises</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><p></p></li>
          <li><p></p></li>

        </ol>
        <h3 id="DockerCompose">Docker-Compose</h3>
        <p>Dockerfile are a very handy tool but that doesn't help you a lot when
        it comes to having simple container working together. As one of the core
        concept of Docker is to have one container per service for ease of comprehension, 
        modification and management.</p>
        <p>In that optic, we shall learn about Docker-compose, a tool created to put
        in relation multiple container by building them through a special configuration
        file. You will soon come to realise that a big part of the things you did in
        your Dockerfile will be done into a Dockercompose file now, but that in no way
        means you are done with them. For a better understanding, here comes an example:</p>
        <pre><code></code></pre>
        <p></p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th><b>Docker-compose element</b></th>
            <th><b>Descriptions</b></th> 
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>version</i></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>volumes</i></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>services</i></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>image</i></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>ports</i></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>expose</i></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h2 id="Deployment">Deployment</h2>
        <p>There are many ways to deploy an application that as been developed with
        a Docker environment, but we will only see two of them here. The goal being
        to understand how easy it makes deployment process to have the same environment
        to develop and deploy.</p>
        <h3 id="Deploy">Deploy</h3>
        <h4 id="Servers">Servers</h4>
        <p>To deploy on a server or local machine manually you must install Docker
        and run the application as you would on your local machine.</p>
        <h4 id="Services">Services</h4>
        <p>To deploy with a service such as Heroku you must simply feed it your
        images.</p>
