# Deployment

## Introduction
For this last interactive part the challenge would be to deploy a small project
with the help of Docker. The goal being to demonstrate the ease of not having to
configure the server since the custom image for the development environment and
the deployment environment are one and the same.


## Plan
As the last "learning part" the plan is to teach how you can deploy any type of
application with Docker and how it makes the setup an easier task. For that the
attendees should quickly develop a small app with the help of their newly 
created development environment. Then the best would be to have both a manual
deployment on a local server and another one on a service such as Heroku.

Of course there are other and more automated way but those should be discovered
by the attendees if they like the ops side of things, a topic for another
workshop perhaps.


## Deploy
As mentioned before, the deployment will be done in two times, on a local server
or machine and with the help of a service.

### Server
You should begin with the server or local machine deployment as it best
demonstrate the ease of setup and implementation. Indeed, you end up just having
to install docker on the machine or server and run the containers.

### Service
As for the service approach I suggest using Heroku as it is a very simple to
setup process. Although, knowing that the goal is to show the possibility does
not matter what you use as long as you give an example.
