        <h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to this introduction to the world of Docker, if you want to learn
        a new technology, discover a DevOps tool or understand how you can make your
        life as a developer or system administrator easier, then look no further!</p>
        <p>You might not become expert at the end of the day, but you will have gathered
        enough knowledge to improve your skills and set of tools. Furthermore, you will know
        how to use Docker, create your own container, make a custom development environment
        and deploy very easily with Docker.</p>
        <p>Notice that this Github page is nothing more than a guide to help you through
        the learning process. I take the stance that to learn you need to exercise but
        even more importantly research. As such you won't be given every piece of info
        on the technology but the very basics and you will be advised to go to the doc or
        ask questions to have a deeper understanding and finish this workshop with success.</p>
        <!-- First part of the workshop  -->
        <h2 id="Docker">Docker</h2>
        During the next hour or so you will learn the very basics of Docker commands
        and Dockerfile. With the help of which you'll be ready to face your first
        challenge, being able to create a simple container.
        <h3 id="Install">Installation</h3>
        <p>Before anything we will have to install docker and configure it for the
        first time. Sadly and as is often the case in computer science, there is
        no one way to install for all the operating system, but don't dispear it's
        an easy process noneless.</p>
        <h4 id="Linux">Linux</h4>
        <p>On a linux distribution Docker is as simple to install as using your
        package manager.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Ubuntu</b>:</li>
          <pre><code>sudo apt-get install docker</code></pre>
          <li><b>Archlinux</b>:</li>
          <pre><code>sudo pacman -S docker</code></pre>
        </ul>
        <p>You could also install Docker manually, refer to the website for more info.</p>
        <h4 id="Windows">Windows</h4>
        <p>For windows, you can find the Docker community edition by following this
        link and the instruction to install.</p>
        <a href="https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows">Download</a>
        <h4 id="MacOS">MacOS</h4>
        <p>For Mac, you can find the Docker community edition by following this
        link and the instruction to install.</p>
        <a href="https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac">Download</a>
        <h3 id="Commands">Commands</h3>
        <p>Docker can be controlled with a plethora of commands in the terminal.
        These commands can vary from helping you run, create, analyze and much more.
        Yet, if you wanted to learn all of them it would take you more than a day 
        no doubt, which is why, in the table below, you will found a selection
        of the most important ones as well as a small description.</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th><b>Commands</b></th>
            <th><b>Descriptions</b></th> 
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>pull</i></td>
            <td>Pull an image on your local machine</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>run</i></td>
            <td>Pull and run an image on your local machine</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>build</i></td>
            <td>Create an image from a Dockerfile</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>ps</i></td>
            <td>List the containers on you system and their infos</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>images</i></td>
            <td>List the images on your system and their infos</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>rm</i></td>
            <td>Remove a container from your system</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>rmi</i></td>
            <td>Remove an image from your system</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>As said before there are more commands associated with Docker but if
        you understand the ones above you're already set for a good start. However,
        for more info, you can use <kbd>man docker command</kbd> on any unix
        system or follow this link to some 
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/">documentation</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="DockerfileDocker">Dockerfile: part one</h3>
        <p>A Dockerfile is very much like a script, you just have to indicate what
        step you want your image to go throw before it is created.</p>
        <p>Let's say you want a container with Ubuntu and a couple of packages already
        installed, plus you want it to execute a bunch of commands automatically
        for you. Let's look at an example:</p>
        <pre><code>
          From ubuntu 

          RUN echo "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main universe" > /etc/apt/sources.list
          RUN apt-get update
          RUN apt-get upgrade -y

          CMD echo "Hello world, I'm up to date."
        </code></pre>
        <p>This example can be decomposed as such, the first command of each line
        is part of the Dockerfile syntax followed by instruction in regard to that
        command. The said instruction, in the example above, are: the canvas of our
        image (FROM) of which you can have multiple, bash commands to execute
        during the creation of the container (RUN) or after it's creation (CMD). Note that
        you can only use "CMD" once per Dockerfile as it's set the entrypoint with an executable
        or a default application, like bash.</p>
        <p>During this first part on Dockerfile we won't go much further as we shall
        see more complex features during the second part, but for more info here
        is a link to some 
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder">documentation</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="ExoDocker">Exercises</h3>
        <p>The best way to learn being to practice hero comes some exercises to put
        yourself to the test.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Pull the image "busybox"</p></li>
          <li><p>List the existing image(s)</p></li>
          <li><p>Run the image "hello-world"</p></li>
          <li><p>List all the existing container(s)</p></li>
          <li><p>Run a container "busybox" with an interactive terminal</p></li>
          <li><p>Run a container "busybox" with an interactive terminal and the current
          directory as mounted volume inside the "test" directory of the container</p></li>
          <li><p>Remove the existing container(s)</p></li>
          <li><p>Remove the existing image(s)</p></li>
          <li><p>Create, build and run a custom image with a Dockerfile based on "busybox"
          and make it output the sentence "I created my first custom image"</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you finished all the exercises before the time is up, you should either
        help others or improve your skills with what you learned so far.</p>

        <!-- Second part of the workshop -->
        <h2 id="Development">Development</h2>
        <p>Here comes the biggest part, we will be working on Dockerfile and Docker-Compose
        until 15:00. Don't worry it won't be all theory, on the contrary the goal for this
        part being for you to create your own development environment.</p>
        <h3 id="DockerfileDev">Dockerfile: part two</h3>
        <p>Now that you are a little more experienced with Dockerfile we will sink
        deeper into the rabbit hole. You can tweaks a lot of things with the help of
        the Docker syntax, the files you want to use, the port on which your container
        is listening, etc ... So during this part we will explore some of these
        advance features by first looking at an example:</p>
        <pre><code>
          FROM python:latest

          WORKDIR /Dockerfile
          ADD . /Dockerfile
          RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
          EXPOSE 80
          ENV NAME="Marvin"

          CMD ["python", "app.py"]
        </code></pre>
        <p>In this example we use the latest python version, we then tell the
        container that we want to work in the directory Dockerfile (for the next commands)
        and mount the local directory Dockerfile inside the container. After which we run a
        command to install dependencies, make the container listen on the port 80, create a 
        variable of environment (NAME) and finally run the application.</p>
        <p>By itself that might not seems like much, but you must realise that with
        this dockerfile you create an environment allowing you to run a python and
        use env variable. You can find all the files necessary to play with that example
        <a href="https://github.com/Marvin-LOUIS/Docker-Workshop/tree/master/Development/Dockerfile">
        here</a>.</p>
        <p>The example above as shown you a couple of new features, to help you in your
        exercises here is a table showing them to you with a small description.</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th><b>Dockerfile element</b></th>
            <th><b>Descriptions</b></th> 
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>FROM</i></td>
            <td>Initialize the build by choosing a base image</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>RUN</i></td>
            <td>Execute a command as a new layer in the image, during it's creation</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>CMD</i></td>
            <td>Execute a command or set a default, there can be only one CMD per Dockerfile</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>WORKDIR</i></td>
            <td>Sets the working directory for the other instructions</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>ADD</i></td>
            <td>Mount files from the host to the filesystem of the container</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>EXPOSE</i></td>
            <td>Tell Docker that the container is listening on the specified port</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>As always you can go further and discover how much more powerful you
        can get!!!! For more info a link to some documentation on 
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder">Dockerfile</a>.</p>
        <h4 id="ExoDockerfile">Exercises</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Create a Dockerfile based on php and make it execute a php server
          (the native server to php)</p></li>
          <li><p>Use that container to create a php application and run it</p></li>
          <li><p>Modify you Dockerfile and install laravel on it</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="DockerCompose">Docker-Compose</h3>
        <p>Dockerfile are a very handy tool but that doesn't help you a lot when
        it comes to having simple container working together. As one of the core
        concept of Docker is to have one container per service for ease of comprehension, 
        modification and management.</p>
        <p>In that optic, we shall learn about Docker-compose, a tool created to put
        in relation multiple container by building them through a special configuration
        file (written in yaml) You will soon come to realise that a big part of the things
        you did in your Dockerfile will be done into a Dockercompose file now, but that in no way
        means you are done with them. For a better understanding, here comes an example:</p>
        <pre><code>
          version: '3'

          volumes:
            database_data:
              driver: local

          services:

            nginx:
              image: nginx:latest
              ports:
                - 8080:80
              volumes:
                - ./nginx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

            php:
              build: ./php/
              expose:
                - 9000
              volumes:
                - .:/var/www/html

            mysql:
                image: mysql:latest
                expose:
                    - 3306
                  volumes:
                    - database_data:/var/lib/mysql
                  environment:
                    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
                    MYSQL_DATABASE: project
                    MYSQL_USER: project
                    MYSQL_PASSWORD: project
          </code></pre>
        <p>This example might be long and seem complex but all it does is, instancing
        the version for the Docker-compose syntax, define the volumes and setup the
        services.</p>
        <p>The first service used is nginx, for the server side, we tell it that we
        want the last version of nginx, we also ask the service to listen to the port 80,
        to be linked to the host on the port 8080 and finally to load the configuration
        file (stored locally) to it's rightful place inside the container.</p>
        <p>Then comes the php service which create a custon image build based on a Dockefile
        stored locally, then we ask it to listen to the port 9000 and load and file in the
        current directory of the host to the location "/var/www/html"</p>
        <p>Finally, we have the mysql service, we first ask it to use the last image possible
        then to listen to the port 3306, mount the database and we finish by setting up
        environment variables.</p>
        <p>Ones again this file is part of bigger example, if you want to see it click 
        <a href="https://github.com/Marvin-LOUIS/Docker-Workshop/tree/master/Development/Docker-Compose">
        here</a>.</p>
        <p>As all this might be a little to much to take in one shot, here is a table
        summarizing it with a small description.</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th><b>Docker-compose element</b></th>
            <th><b>Descriptions</b></th> 
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>version</i></td>
            <td>Sets the version for the Docker-compose syntax</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

            <td>Link the host and the container port</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i>expose</i></td>
            <td>Tell the container to listen on the said port</td>
          </tr>

        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/">Docker-Compose</a>.</p>
        <h4 id="ExoDockerCompose">Exercises</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Create a Docker-compose with php, apache and mysql</p></li>
          <li><p>Develop a small app to test the services</p></li>
          <li><p>Replace apache by httpd</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Ones you are finished you should start creating your custom development environment
        and if you're so quick that it's also finished before the end of this part, then share
        your wisdom to your neighbors.</p>

        <!-- Third part of the workshop -->
        <h2 id="Deployment">Deployment</h2>
        <p>There are many ways to deploy an application that as been developed with
        a Docker environment, but we will only see one of them here. The goal being
        to understand how easy it makes the deployment process to have the same environment
        to develop and deploy.</p>
        <h3 id="Deploy">Deploy</h3>
        <h4 id="Servers">Servers</h4>
        <p>To deploy on a server or local machine you must install Docker, build your
        image and run the application as you would on your local machine.</p>
        <pre><code>docker build -t myimage .<br>docker run myimage</code></pre>
        <p>It's a very easy process, but tedious as you must do everything manually. A
        solution could be to create a small script automating the ordeal, but it wouldn't
        be compatible on every operating system.</p>
        <p>You could also put your image on a dockerhub repository and simply pull and
        run it whenever necessary. If you put the Dockerfile on a Github repository you
        will of course have to pull it with git.</p>
        <pre><code>docker pull myimage<br>docker run myimage</code></pre>
        <p>If you have enough time you should try to automate the process, use any
        technology, as long as it makes everything simpler.</p>
        <h3 id="ExoDeploy">Exercises</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Develop an application with the environment you created yourself 
          during the last part</p></li>
          <li><p>Deploy your application on the machine of one your neighbors</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your used to it know if you're so quick that you put me to shame then help
        you friends, or go search the web for more information.</p>

        <h2 id="Conclu">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Here we are the workshop is finished, I hope you enjoyed and learned a lot
        during our time together. After all, we learned enough of Docker today for you
        to know if you want to spend more time using it or not. Now would probably be
        a good time for a little debrief.</p>
