# Presentation

## Introduction
The presentation part serve the purpose of breaking the ice and give the basics
of Docker. In practice, that means explaining the technology and give its
vocabulary for a better and smoother experience down the road.


## Plan
The plan for the presentation is to give a small preface to the workshop,
introduce the technology and define the inherent vocabulary of Docker.

To do that, a small PDF presentation has been written, it is mainly composed of
images to be as pleasing and captivating as possible. However, the text that is
associated with each slides is on this page, the purpose of this design choice
is to explain with telling pictures backed up by explanation from the person
giving the workshop.


## Resources
The only resources needed for the presentation are the text associated with each
slides and the slides themselves. I wanted this presentation to be as simple and
minimalistic as possible, but if you feel that a more complex one is preferable,
you should create one and share it.
