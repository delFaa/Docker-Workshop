# Docker Workshop

## Introduction
The goal of this workshop is to introduce **Docker** and explain it's importance
on **development environment** and **deployment**. The goal for the attendees
being to grasp the reason of Docker success and understand how it simplify
development process as well as the deployment of any, small or big, application.


## Timetable
The workshop is designed to take a day of work, the idea being not to drawn in
theory or demonstration but to practice as much as possible and understand by
failure and success.

## Content of the Workshop

### Presentation (20 min)
The presentation part serve the purpose of breaking the ice and give the basics
of Docker. In practice, that means explaining the technology and give its
vocabulary for a better and smoother experience down the road.

### Docker (75 min)
This would be the first interactive part, the idea here being to play with
simple image such as **busybox** and understand core concept of Docker such as
the isolation of the container from the system, there destructibility and there
flexibility.

### Development environment (180 min)
The development environment part would be focus on how to create an appropriate
image for ones need and how to simplify the development process. It's even more
important to let the attendees play around and customize there images in this
section, for it's a fundamental part of Docker. One important tool to be learned
here being **docker-compose**.

### Deployment (75 min)
For this last interactive part the challenge would be to deploy a small project
with the help of Docker. The goal being to demonstrate the ease of not having to
configure the server since with the help of custom image the development
environment and the deployment environment are one and the same.

### Conclusion (30 min)
To finish the workshop I advice for a small discussion/debate between everyone
on what as been learned, how is it useful and how they plan to use it or not.
That conclusion would, in my opinion, close the workshop in such a way that
everyone has more than his/her own opinion on the technology. It also serve the
purpose of giving a feedback on the workshop.
