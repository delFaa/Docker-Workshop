# Development

## Introduction
The development environment part should be focused on how to create, configure
and use custom images. All that to end up with an appropriate and working
environment tailored for ones need. Which would demonstrate the potential of 
simplification of the development process. It's also important, during this 
phase, to emphasise the separation of service in different containers and 
therefore introduce **docker-compose** as a tool to bind an application
together.


## Plan
During this part, the plan is to expand the knowledge of custom images with
Dockerfile and in a second time to play around with Docker-Compose. The goal at 
the end of this part being to be comfortable researching and creating a tailored
development environment.


## Dockerfile
Now that the attendees have an idea on how to use a Dockerfile they should be
encouraged to research more about it's capability and limits. After which they
should exercise. 

### Exercises

```

```

Once they are more confident on what they know, you could follow up with a more
complex example such as this one, [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).


## Docker-compose
The biggest and hardest part of this workshop is probably the comprehension of
Docker-Compose. That's why you should press the importance and logic behind the
separation of the different service in an application.
