# Conclusion

## Introduction
To finish the workshop I advice for a small discussion/debate between everyone
on what as been learned, how it might be useful and how they plan to use it or
not. That conclusion should, in my opinion, close the workshop in such a way
that everyone has more than his/her own opinion on the technology. It would also
serve the purpose of giving a feedback on the workshop.


## Plan
The plan for the conclusion is to have a talk about the workshop to finish it on
a constructive note. To start the discussion some examples of questions have
been gathered in the resources section. If any problem have been found an issue
should be created in the hope of improving the workshop.


### Questions
There is a list of potential questions to start the debate if nobody knows what
to say.
  * Was the workshop a good and enjoyable experience?
  * Do you feel confident with your new knowledge to explore Docker further?
  * What part of the workshop would you change or improve?
